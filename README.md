# KAPLAYWARE 
Or KONSOLE???

Warioware-styled game made in KAPLAY not entirely related to KAPLAY but uses a bunch of its assets and artstyle

The idea is that each microgame has to have a hardmode version where the gameplay changes, this is part of its design which i will elaborate further at some point

// TODO: do the run a single game thing (pnpm testgame)
